## Research Overview

My work is currently related to research in and at the intersection of the broader fields of statistical physics, biological physics, fluid and solid mechanics, notably known as soft condensed matter.

Currently, I work with the following problems:

## Current Topics

### Biological membranes

Biological membranes make up the boundaries of cells and other internal organelles. They typically act as selective barriers to different molecules and are responsible for the survival of a cell. Understanding the organization and behavior of biological membranes is important in many biological processes. The physical state of biological membranes at any instant of time may depend on many complex chemical, thermal, mechanical, and interrelated changes in the surroundings. My research concerns understanding the physical principles of organization of biological membranes at all length and time scales. This includes understanding the forces governing the assembly of proteins at the molecular level to morphological transitions at macroscopic levels.

### Bioelectricity

Bioelectricity concerns how cells create, control, and use voltage, currents, and electric fields to perform biological processes.
