I am an associate professor in the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering (CBE) at UC Berkeley.

I am a theorist and my interests broadly lie in understanding the physical behaviors of systems at multiple length and time scales. My research is at the intersection of statistical mechanics, continuum mechanics (fluid and solid mechanics), and applied mathematics.

Materials behave differently at different length and time scales. The combination of properties at one length scale leads to interesting emergent behaviors at larger length scales. My interests broadly lie in discovering the emergent physical principles of behavior of materials at different length and time scales.

Currently, I work with problems in the field of physics of soft and living systems related to three main topics :

- Principles of organization in biological membranes
- Physics of active matter and applications to biological systems
- Physical principles governing amorphous systems and glassy dynamics

For some more information about me, please see my [CV]({{ site.baseurl }}/cv.html).
